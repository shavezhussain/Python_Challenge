**Using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for PyBank and PyPoll Data Analysis**

Welcome to the repository containing two exciting Python projects: PyBank and PyPoll. These projects delve into datasets, extracting valuable insights using the powerful capabilities of Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

## Project Structure

Navigate through the repository's well-organized structure:

- **PyBank Folder**:
  - **resources Sub-folder**: Houses the dataset used for detailed financial analysis.
  - **analysis Sub-folder**: Presents the output text file produced from financial analysis.
  - **main.py**: The Python script responsible for performing in-depth financial data analysis.

- **PyPoll Folder**:
  - **resources Sub-folder**: Contains the dataset for thorough election analysis.
  - **analysis Sub-folder**: Holds the output text file generated during election analysis.
  - **main.py**: The Python script that executes the intricate election data analysis.

## PyBank - Delving into Financials

The `PyBank` project is a playground for financial enthusiasts. It undertakes the following pivotal tasks:

- Computes the total count of months featured in the dataset.
- Calculates the overall net sum of "Profit/Losses" throughout the recorded period.
- Tracks the fluctuations in "Profit/Losses" over time, calculating the average of these changes.
- Identifies both the most significant profit increase and decrease, complete with their respective dates.

Experience this financial journey by running `main.py` located within the `PyBank` folder.

## PyPoll - Unveiling Election Insights

In the realm of `PyPoll`, election data gets unraveled to present gripping insights. The project takes on the following mission:

- Evaluates the total number of votes cast during the election.
- Enumerates all the candidates who garnered votes.
- Computes the total votes each candidate secured.
- Determines the percentage of votes each candidate received.
- Recognizes the election champion based on the popular vote.

Witness the magic unfold by executing `main.py` found within the `PyPoll` folder.

## How to Engage

Let's embark on this data exploration using Visual Studio Code (VSCode):

1. Clone the repository using the command `git clone <https://github.com/shavezhussain/Python_Challenge>`.

2. Navigate to the specific project folder you're eager to investigate, be it PyBank or PyPoll.

3. Confirm that you've installed the essential dependencies.

4. Initiate the analysis by executing the `main.py` script. Behold the results within the terminal, and watch the output text file come to life within the `analysis` sub-folder.

5. Immerse yourself in the outcomes presented both in the terminal and the text file, capturing the essence of your data-driven journey.
